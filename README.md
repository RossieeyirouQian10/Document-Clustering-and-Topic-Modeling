# Document-Clustering-and-Topic-Modeling-on-Watches-User-Reviews
Cluster unlabeled documents into different groups and identify their latent topics based on user review of watches

In this project, we use unsupervised learning models to cluster unlabeled documents into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.


•	Configure a pipeline to cluster unlabeled watches user reviews into different groups and identify critical latent structures 
•	Apply tokenization and Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) functions to get TF-IDF matrix with selected useful words 
•	Calculate matrix similarity and train unsupervised learning models with K-Means Clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) 
•	Check potential semantic reviews and keywords from 5 different clusters or topics to evaluate model performance
